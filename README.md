 -ESP32 Smart Fingerprint Access Control System

A smart door security system built using the **ESP32**, integrating:
- R305 Fingerprint Sensor for identity verification
- SG90 Servo Motor for physical door control
- OLED display for real-time access status
- Buzzer and LEDs for immediate feedback

This compact and effective system ensures secure, biometric-based access control suitable for smart homes, labs, and restricted areas.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Working of the Project

1. **System Boot**:  
   On power-up, the ESP32 connects all peripherals and checks for the fingerprint sensor. The OLED displays initial system messages.

2. **Fingerprint Detection**:  
   The system continuously waits for a finger to be placed on the sensor.

3. **Matching Process**:  
   - If a stored fingerprint is matched:
     - OLED displays: **"Access Granted: Opening Door"**
     - Green LED turns on
     - Buzzer sounds
     - Servo rotates to unlock (open) the door
     - After a delay, the servo returns to the locked position, and the system resets
   - If no match is found:
     - OLED displays: **"No Match Found"**
     - Red LED turns on briefly

4. **Enrollment Mode (via Serial Monitor)**:
   - Command `enroll <id>` is used to add a new fingerprint.
   - The system guides the user through placing the same finger twice.
   - Upon successful enrollment, the fingerprint is stored under the given ID.

5. **Input Mode for Testing (Optional)**:
   - Send `input` via Serial Monitor to enter manual test mode.
   - You can simulate actions with commands like `p1`, `p2`, etc.
   - Use `exit` to return to normal fingerprint mode.

| `p<number>`     | Simulates a fingerprint match (for testing)      |
| `exit`          | Exits manual input mode                          |
| `enroll <id>`   | Enrolls a new fingerprint with specified ID      |
